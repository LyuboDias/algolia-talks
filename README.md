## Description

I have build this simple app using Algolia Instant Search and Autocomplete. It replicates TED Talks.
Here are some of the key points:

- Recent search history
- Searchable attributes: Name, Speaker, Description and Event.
- Filters for Tags, Events and Speakers.
- Pagination limited to 1k Hits.
- SortBy: Most Views and Best Rated
- Mobile responsive with filters menu toggled
- Added A/B testing ( PopularScore vs ViewedCount )
## Known Bugs üêû and Enhancements:

- Tags filters search bar not working :/
- Need styling changes throughout the page to reflect real TED website
- Main search bar doesnt have query suggestions
- Every Hit should be clickable and take user to Hit page with fill information
- On mobile when show filters and apply some, will reset if close the filters menu
- Index of query_suggestions has 17 records but has not been implemented into Main search bar
- Code base need refactoring ( + add SasS )
